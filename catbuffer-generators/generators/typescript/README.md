# catbuffer-typescript

The catbuffer library helps serialize and deserialize NEM's Catapult entities in Typescript / Javascript applications.

The library's main client is the NEM typescript SDK [symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript](https://github.com/nemtech/symbol-sdk-typescript-javascript) but it can be used alone.

It has been generated using [catbuffer-generators](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer-generators) from the [catbuffer](https://github.com/nemtech/catbuffer) specification.
